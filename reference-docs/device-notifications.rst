**Detailed Properties Description**

- model 
   Object that represents message structure and data. It consists of "frames", "sound" and "cycles" properties.

   - *frames* – array, that describes the notification structure. Single frame can be *simple*, *goal* or *spike chart*.
      
      - *simple* frame consists of icon and text. Example::
       
         {
            "icon":"<icon_id or binary>",
            "text":"Message"
         }

      - *goal* frame consists of icon and goal data. Example::

         { 
           "icon":"i120",
           "goalData":{
             "start": 0,
             "current": 50,
             "end": 100,
             "unit": "%"
            }
         }

      - *spike chart* consists of array of numbers and is displayed as graph. Example:: 

         {
            "chartData": [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]
         }



   - *sound* – object that describes the notification sound to play when notification pops on the LaMetric Time's screen. Example::

      {
    	"category":"notifications",
        "id":"cat",
        "repeat":1
      }

     - *category* – sound category. Can be *notifications* or *alarms*.
     - *id* – sound ID. Full list of notification ids::
			
		bicycle         
		car            
		cash           
		cat

     - *repeat* – defines the number of times sound must be played. If set to 0 sound will be played until notification is dismissed. By default the value is set to 1.

   - *cycles* – the number of times message should be displayed. If *cycles* is set to 0, notification will stay on the screen until user dismisses it manually or you can dismiss it via the API (DELETE /api/v2/device/notifications/:id). By default it is set to 1.

- priority
   Priority of the message
   
   - *info* – this priority means that notification will be displayed on the same "level" as all other notifications on the device that come from apps (for example facebook app). This notification will not be shown when screensaver is active. By default message is sent with "info" priority. This level of notification should be used for notifications like news, weather, temperature, etc.

   - *warning* – notifications with this priority will interrupt ones sent with lower priority ("info"). Should be used to notify the user about something important but not critical. For example, events like "someone is coming home" should use this priority when sending notifications from smart home.

   - *critical* – the most important notifications. Interrupts notification with priority *info* or *warning* and is displayed even if screensaver is active. Use with care as these notifications can pop in the middle of the night. Must be used only for really important notifications like notifications from smoke detectors, water leak sensors, etc. Use it for events that require human interaction immediately.

- icon_type
    Represents the nature of notification.

    - *none* – no notification icon will be shown.
    - *info* – "i" icon will be displayed prior to the notification. Means that notification contains information, no need to take actions on it.
    - *alert* – "!!!" icon will be displayed prior to the notification. Use it when you want the user to pay attention to that notification as it indicates that something bad happened and user must take immediate action.

- lifetime
    The time notification lives in queue to be displayed in milliseconds. Default lifetime is 2 minutes. If notification stayed in queue for longer than *lifetime* milliseconds – it will not be displayed.

	    "priority": "critical",
